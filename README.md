## Purpose
I'm excited to share the OSSU Introduction to Computer Science course, tailored for data analytics professionals like me with a BS and MS in Data Analytics. Here's why I think it's valuable:

Solid Foundations: Even with my advanced degrees, the basic computer science principles taught here are invaluable.

Programming Skills: It covers essential programming languages like Python in a general framework instead of highly specific to data flat files/sql pulls, enhancing my data handling capabilities.
    
Algorithmic Thinking: Improving my ability to think algorithmically has been crucial for efficient data processing.
    
Problem-Solving: The course sharpens problem-solving skills, key in tackling complex data analytics challenges.
    
Broad Knowledge: Topics like software engineering and databases offer new perspectives for my data projects.
    
Networking: I've connected with a diverse learning community, enriching my professional network.
